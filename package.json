All credit for the design inspiration goes to ~[Alan Hortle](https://github.com/allanhortle).\n\n![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/jamesmacfie/centurion-ui/master/screenshot.png)\n\nCenturion was \"made out of a want for less UI and more code. It's so minimal you can barely see it. No gradients, no 1px edges and not a thousand different icon sprites.\"\n\n## To Install\n\n`apm install centurion-ui`\n\nActivated by going to the `Themes` section in the Settings view (`cmd + ,`) and selecting it from the\n`UI Themes` drop-down menu.\n",
